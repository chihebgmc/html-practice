# Ragdoll

## Tasks

1.  We’ll spend the rest of the lesson building an informational website using some of the most common HTML elements. We’ve put some elements in to get you started, but you’ll write the rest of the page on your own.

    Below the `<h1>` heading that says `Ragdoll`, add an `<h2>` heading that says `About Ragdoll cats`.

2.  Below the `About Ragdoll cats` heading, add `<p>` paragraph that says:

        The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue eyes. Its morphology is large and weighty, and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat.

3.  On the next line, add one more `<h2>` heading that says `Breed description`.

4.  Below the `Breed description` heading, add `<h3>` heading that says `Temperament`.
5.  Below the `Temperament` heading, add `<p>` paragraph that says:

        The Ragdoll has been known to have a very floppy and calm nature, with
        claims that these characteristics have been passed down from the Persian and Birman breeds.

6.  Add another `<p>` paragraph that says:

        Opinions vary as to whether this trait might be the result of genetic mutation or merely an instinctive reaction from being picked up as kittens by their mother.The extreme docility of some individuals has led to the myth that Ragdolls are resistant. Some breeders in Britain have tried to breed away from the limpness owing to concerns that extreme docility "might not be in the best interests of the cat".

7.  On the next line, add one more `<h3>` heading that says `Physical characteristics`.

8.  Below the `Physical characteristics` heading, add `<h4>` heading that says `Patterns`

9.  Add an unordered list `<ul>` with three list items `<li>`.

10. In each item add the following: `Colorpoint`, `Mitted` and `Bicolor`.

11. On the next line, add one more `<h4>` heading that says `Variations`.

12. Add an unordered list `<ul>` with two list items `<li>`.

13. In each item add the following: `Lynx` and `Tortoiseshell`.

14. Add `<hr>` horizontal rule.

15. Add `<img>` image with `src` attribute

16. in `src` attribute, add the relative path to the image inside `img folder`.

17. The image is very big, so add `width` attribute and assign `300` to it.
